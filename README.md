# AWS Event-Driven Notification System
## Overview

This project implements a production-style event-driven notification system using AWS services.

The system is designed to demonstrate:
- Decoupled architecture
- Fan-out messaging
- Asynchronous processing
- Idempotent consumers
- Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) handling
- Infrastructure-as-Code using CloudFormation

The architecture follows distributed systems best practices for reliability and scalability.
